Re-Web is a day dedicated to those who wish for a more sustainable infrastructure and system. We aim to explore how we can prepare for a finite, post-climate change earth through practical and hands on action, initiated by conversation.

There will be no speakers, instead we have facilitated conversations, harvested and shared with a larger European network of Edgeryders as part of a distributed festival in order to let the word spread far beyond our physical space, while also finding each other in the flesh. 

The intention is to create a network of people who are interested in transforming the world and to have conversations about this, in line with the topics at hand. This event is held as part of a continental festival held in 10 different locations across Europe: https://festival.edgeryders.eu/

The main fields to be focused on is:
- Resilient Tech
- Networks & Communities
- Sustainable Futurism and Solarpunk

This event is bringing together people who are currently directly involved in building, researching, regulating, monetising and or providing meaningful input into the wider debate around the technologies in question. We want to ensure that every participant leaves the venue having presented and discussed their work with others who can provide meaningful input or connect them with opportunities to further their goals. If this appeals to you, then we would love to have you join us. Just create an edgeryders account and introduce yourself to the community.

**How is this all financed?**
This event is part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016. It has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 825652 from 2019-2021. You can learn more about the initiative and our involvement in it at https://ngi.edgeryders.eu

Hope to see you there!
